# Setting up CloudStack

## Dual booting Linux
Since I don't want to have my machines tied down to the cloud I have decided to dual boot Linux on the machines to use in the cloud for KVM reasons, better in essentially every way than Hyper-V, especially important when CloudStack runs on top of the Hypervisor.

CentOS? Or other lightweight distro.

Ubuntu, CentOS or SUSE.

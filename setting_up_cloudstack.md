# Setting up CloudStack

First of all would be interesting to see if possible to integrate phones into the cloud fabric, otherwise I will run webservers or other services on them. Containers on phones? [Sauce](https://gist.github.com/arno01/ebf570af208e28c1a0cf78da4f63bc9c).

## Dualbooting Linux
Since I don't want to have my machines tied down to the cloud I have decided to dual boot Linux on the machines. Primarilly to get accesss KVM, it's features and flexibility.

Furthermote when dualbooting: the windows partition of the disks won't require even half (500gb) of the drives capacity because of my other project [portable_dev](sauce) meaning more resources for the cloud infrastructure.

Some of the machines will be purely booted in Linux as i wont use them for anything else.

CentOS? Or other lightweight distro.

Ubuntu, CentOS or SUSE.
